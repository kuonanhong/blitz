If you are interested in using Blitz with Microsoft's VS .NET 2003 C++
compiler, we have provided a Blitz configuration header file and a Zip
archive containing project files for building the Blitz library and the 
Blitz testsuite codes.  Within the "blitz" subdirectory, copy the file
config-VS.NET2003.h to config.h.  Then unpack the archive Blitz-VS.NET.zip
within the parent directory containing your blitz source files.  This will
produce sibling directories to blitz labeled Blitz-Library and Blitz-Testsuite
that contain the VS .NET project files for building the blitz library and
test codes.  Once these files are unpacked, you should be able to open the
project files using VS .NET 2003 and build the library and tests.  The 
project files for the blitz testsuite codes should provide you with an
example of how to create project files for your own application codes 
that use the blitz library.  Please send any questions or comments to 
the blitz mailing list at blitz-support@oonumerics.org.
