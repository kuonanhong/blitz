2002-06-27  Julian Cummings  <cummings@artemis.cacr.caltech.edu>
	* testsuite/complex-test.cpp: Added some explicit casts to float
	to eliminate precision loss warnings from implicit conversions of
	double to float.  Changed abs() to fabs() for floating-point
	arguments.  abs() is for ints or complex numbers, while fabs() is
	for floating-point numbers.
	* testsuite/chris-jeffery-1.cpp: Slight change to eliminate
	precision loss warning from double/float conversion.
	* blitz/array/storage.h: Use _bz_bool and _bz_true where
	appropriate to avoid int/bool conversions.
	* blitz/array/fastiter.h: Changed order of ctor initializers to
	match order of member data declarations, eliminating warning from
	gcc compiler.
	* blitz/array/slicing.cc: Modified valid indexing check to avoid
	casting to unsigned.
	* blitz/shapecheck.h: Changed loop variable i to unsigned to avoid
	unsigned/signed comparisons.
	* blitz/array-impl.h: Modified the isInRange() methods to check
	that each index value is greater than or equal to the base index
	value, rather than just casting (index-base) to an unsigned int.
	The latter gives unpredictable results if index<base and produces
	compiler warnings about comparisons between unsigned and signed
	quantities.
	* blitz/tinyvec.h: Changed return type of lengthCheck() method
	from int to _bz_bool.
	* testsuite/extract.cpp: Undid previous change and went back to
	using static const int data members instead of enums for red,
	green and blue.  These have to be actual ints, or else the Array
	operator[] does not work properly.  Need to investigate further
	the link-time error that occurs with this test code when using
	xlC.

2002-06-26  Julian Cummings  <cummings@artemis.cacr.caltech.edu>
	* configure: Rebuilt from configure.in.
	* configure.in: Moved package and version arguments back to
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro call.  The new style suggested in the
	automake documentation doesn't seem to work right when the tarball
	name contains uppercase letters and is not trivially derived from
	the package name.
	* configure.in: Added section to handle xlC as a valid C++
	compiler option.  Moved package name and version number arguments
	to AC_INIT macro.  Moved AC_CANONICAL_TARGET macro call higher up
	in file to eliminate autoconf warning.
	* config.guess: Commented out use of oslevel command on AIX
	platform to get OS version and release info, since it does not
	always seem to report the right thing and can send confusing
	output to config.sub.
	* examples/Makefile.in: Rebuilt from examples/Makefile.am.
	* examples/Makefile.am: Added profile.cpp, tiny2.cpp and tiny3.cpp
	to EXTRA_DIST, so that these files will be included in the
	distribution tarball.  This is necessary because these files are
	not include in SOURCES and are not normally compiled.
	* testsuite/extract.cpp: Changed members red, green and blue of
	class RGB24 from static const int's to enumerators in order to
	avoid a link-time error with xlC compiler.
	* blitz/tinyvec.h: Changed P_numtype to T_numtype inside class
	definition consistently.
	* blitz/array-impl.h: Changed template parameter name T_numtype2
	to P_numtype2 in member function template declarataions for
	consistency with definitions and to avoid any confusion with
	typedef T_numtype.
	* blitz/array/slicing.cc: Changed T_numtype to P_numtype when used
	outside the argument list or body of a member function definition
	(i.e., outside the class scope).  Inside the class scope, we can
	use the typedef T_numtype.  The IBM xlC compiler gets confused if
	P_numtype is used as a template parameter name in a member
	function declaration and then T_numtype is used as the parameter
	name in the member function definition.  Fixed usage to be more
	consistent.
	* blitz/array/methods.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/ops.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/tinyvec.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/et.h: Added #include of blitz/array/misc.cc if not
	using new expression templates.
	* blitz/array-impl.h: Explicitly specify second template argument
	for ListInitializationSwitch, rather than relying on the default
	value.  This eliminates a compilation problem using the xlC
	compiler.  Also removed #include of misc.cc, which is now handled
	in blitz/array/et.h.
	* blitz/tinymat.h: Likewise.
	* blitz/tinyvec.h: Likewise.

2002-05-27  Julian Cummings  <cummings@tis-sa-ack.cacr.caltech.edu>
	* blitz/array-impl.h: Removed use of this-> as means of accessing
	members of templated base class.  Instead provided using
	declarations for these members within the derived class
	definitions to bring them into the scope of the derived class.
	* blitz/array/slicing.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/eval.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/methods.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/storage.h: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/stencil-et.h: Likewise.
	* blitz/array/iter.h: Likewise.
	* blitz/matrix.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/vector.cc: Likewise.
	* blitz/memblock.h: Likewise.
	* blitz/matrix.h: Likewise.
	* blitz/vector.h: Likewise.

Fri May 24 10:25:23 CEST 2002 Patrick Guio <patrick.guio@fys.uio.no>
	* INSTALL: added instruction for cvs repository installation in case a
	problem should occur with the build system.
	* configure.in: removed some unecessary check
	* configure: regenerated with autoconf 2.53, automake 1.6.1, libtool 1.4.2
	* every Makefile.in: likewise

Thu May 23 17:08:43 CEST 2002 Patrick Guio <patrick.guio@fys.uio.no>
	* configure.in: added support for ranlib on SGI that failed and a few

	DECcxx.
	* blitz/Makefile.am: added tinymatio.cc in the blitz_HEADERS variable
	* configure: regenerated with autoconf 2.53, automake 1.6.1, libtool 1.4.2
	* every Makefile.in: likewise

2002-05-22  Julian Cummings  <cummings@artemis.cacr.caltech.edu>
	* blitz/array/eval.cc: Fixed bug in
	Array::evaluateWithIndexTraversal1() by removing cast of second
	argument to T_numtype in call to T_update::update().  This cast
	will occur automatically when the update operation is performed.
	This fixes a problem reported by Masahiro Tatsumi
	<tatsumi@nfi.co.jp> in which one could not assign a double to an
	Array of TinyVectors of double without explicitly constructing a
	TinyVector of doubles on the right-hand side.  Also fixed an
	unused variable warning emanating from the function
	Array::evaluateWithFastTraversal() by moving the definition of
	local variable "last" so that it is only seen if it is used.
	* blitz/tinymatio.cc: new file (I/O operations for blitz TinyMatrix)
	* blitz/tinymat.h: added #include of <blitz/tinymatio.cc>

Fri May 10 16:25:14 CEST 2002 Patrick Guio <patrick.guio@fys.uio.no>
	* blitz/randref.h: private constructor for template class _bz_VecExprRandom
	did not had an explicit initialiser for the private member random_, added
	it. 
	Compaq C++ V6.5-014 for Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.1A (Rev. 1885) complained
	about this.
	* blitz/array/map.h: likewise for template class ArrayIndexMapping

	* blitz/transversal.cc, blitz/transversal.h: template declaration
	template<int N_dimensions>
	_bz_typename TraversalOrderCollection<N_dimensions>::T_set
	    TraversalOrderCollection<N_dimensions>::traversals_;

	applyStencil(kinEnergy(),A,B); is commented
