Installation procedure

As of the 980404 snapshot, Blitz++ uses GNU autoconf.
This utility handles rewriting Makefiles for various
platforms and compilers.  It has greatly simplified
installation and porting.  Many thanks for John W. Eaton
and Brendan Kehoe for their help with this.

To install blitz, unpack the blitz-VERSION.tar.gz
file (it will install into a subdirectory blitz-VERSION).

Then cd into the subdirectory, and run

./configure --with-cxx=[compiler]

The [compiler] options are:
  --with-cxx=egcs   EGCS (http://egcs.cygnus.com/)
  --with-cxx=KCC    KAI C++ (http://www.kai.com/)
  --with-cxx=cray   Cray C++ 3.0 or better (http://www.cray.com/)
  --with-cxx=DECcxx DEC cxx 6.10 or better (http://www.dec.com/)
  --with-cxx=SGI64  SGI C++ 7.3 or better (http://www.sgi.com/)
  --with-cxx=SGI32          ... with 32-bit ABI (n32)

Once the configure script is done, you can do any of these
things:

        make lib        Check the compiler and create libblitz.a
        make check      Do the above plus build and check the testsuite
        make all        Do all of the above plus build the examples and
                        benchmarks (takes a long time)


OTHER COMPILERS

If you want to try Blitz++ with a compiler not in the above
list, I suggest the following approach:

  1. Go into the compiler subdirectory and run the bzconfig
     script.  This will exercise your compiler to see what
     language features it supports.  If it doesn't have
     member templates and enum computations, just give up.

  2. Install autoconf (from e.g. ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu)
     if you don't have it already.

  3. Make a backup of configure.in, and edit configure.in
     to add appropriate cases for your compiler.  Then invoke
     autoconf to generate the configure script.  Then try
     configure with your new --with-cxx= option.  Repeat
     until it works..

  4. Try building the testsuite ('make check').

  5. Holy schmoly!  It works!  Quick, send these things to
     <tveldhui@seurat.uwaterloo.ca> for incorporation into
     the next blitz release:

        - diffs for configure.in
        - the file <blitz/config.h>
        - name and info about your compiler
