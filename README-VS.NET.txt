If you are interested in using Blitz with Microsoft's VS .NET 2003 C++
compiler, we have provided a Zip archive containing a Blitz configuration 
header file and project files for building the Blitz library and the 
Blitz testsuite codes.  First unpack the archive Blitz-VS.NET.zip into
the top-level blitz directory containing the archive file (i.e., unpack
it in place).  This will produce a Blitz-Library VS.NET solution file and
a sibling directory Blitz-Testsuite that contains the VS.NET project files 
for building the blitz testsuite codes.  Within the "blitz" subdirectory, 
you will also find a config.h Blitz configuration header file that has been
manually produced for the VS.NET 2003 C++ compiler.  Once these files have
been unpacked, you should be able to open the Blitz-Library solution file 
using VS.NET 2003 and build the blitz library and testsuite codes.  The 
project files for the blitz testsuite codes should provide you with an 
example of how to create project files for your own application codes that 
use the blitz library.  Please send any questions or comments to the blitz 
mailing list at blitz-support@oonumerics.org.
